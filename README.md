# Score Board

## Description
This library provides concurrent score board support. It uses ConcurrentHashMap to store scores and games.  

This project also uses [Java 21 Preview Feature String Templates](https://openjdk.org/jeps/430), if you face issue related to that please keep in mind  
that using --enable-preview will help you.
